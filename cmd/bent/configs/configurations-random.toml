# A sample configuration for benchmarking binaries whose function ordering has been randomized.
# This is intended for use with the "-R n" flag and also requires Go > 1.22.
# BENT_K can be provided externally, for example ina shell script doing iterated benchmarking
# or two create a different set of randomized link orders.
#
# Randomized function ordering creates differences in branch/target alignment which can then be
# averaged to remove that artifact from benchmarking results, as recommended by
# Charlie Curtsinger https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2451116.2451141
#
# Benchsize should report slightly different binary sizes if they are correctly linked.
